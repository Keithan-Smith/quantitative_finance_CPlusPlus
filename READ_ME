Hi, 

My name is Keithan Smith and I enjoy financial modelling. In particular the pricing of financial instruments such that we may derive expectations of future macroeconomic events. 
Feel free to parse through the C++ code that I will continue to upload here, and where possible, I will upload the underlying mathematics to support such code.
